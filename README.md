# My News App Using React.js

Hello! this is my React.js project to learn how to fetch data from an API/server side and manage it on the client side.

## About the project

- This project is designed to read news, with all news data retrieved through the API.
- I have implemented an infinite scroll with a spinner (using react-infinite-scroll) and also added a top loading bar (using react-top-loading-bar).

Here some screenshots for your reference...
